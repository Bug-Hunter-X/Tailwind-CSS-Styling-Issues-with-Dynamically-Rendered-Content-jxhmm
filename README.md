# Tailwind CSS Styling Issues with Dynamically Rendered Content

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS with frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt.js: Tailwind classes not being applied to dynamically rendered content.  The problem stems from rendering elements outside the scope of Tailwind directives or improper handling of client-side hydration.

## Bug Description

The bug arises when attempting to apply Tailwind classes to elements rendered dynamically.  The classes are not recognized, and the styles are not applied because these elements are outside the main application's render tree where Tailwind directives can process them.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the development server (e.g., `npm run dev` for Next.js). 
4. Observe that the dynamically rendered content does not have the expected Tailwind styles applied.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that all elements intended to have Tailwind classes are rendered within the scope of the Tailwind directives. This might involve restructuring your components or using techniques to ensure proper hydration.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation that addresses this issue.
